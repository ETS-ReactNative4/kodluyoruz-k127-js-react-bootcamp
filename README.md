### This bootcamp has covered:

- Getting Started: we have delved into the fundamental concepts about React and use them to build practical web applications.
- First, we have saw how to design class components and stateful function component, how to one-way flow data and behavior in a component tree, and how to read and update state elements.
- Then, we have delved into modern JavaScript features used with React like arrow functions, destructuring rest and spread operators, classes, async/await, and more.
- Next, we have learned some core React tasks like taking input from the user, reading data from an API, managing side effects like timers, and sharing stateful logic with custom hooks.
- Next, we have learned using redux as state managemet tool, and firebase as a database for our apps.
- Finally, we have explored how to configure and use a local JavaScript development environment on local machine, and take a look on React Native to develop mobile apps.
